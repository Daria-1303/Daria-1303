## Embedded Systems Training 

### Smart Parking Systems

Participated in Magna Electronics's Academic Labs  program focused on embedded systems, where I:

- Gained foundational understanding of **embedded systems architecture** and **real-time constraints** in automotive electronics
- Developed firmware using **C**, targeting microcontrollers
- Interfaced with **sensors and actuators** through **UART**, **SPI**, and **I2C** communication protocols
- Had the chance to understand the importance of full **automotive software development cycle**: design → coding → simulation → testing → debugging.

### 🚗 Project Overview

This project simulates a smart parking system using a **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino**, featuring real-time **license plate detection**, **automated barrier movement**, and **entry/exit logging** using a **MariaDB** database.

### Tools & Technologies Used
| Component | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Microcontroller | Arduino UNO |
| SBC (Single-Board Computer) | Raspberry Pi 4 |
| Programming Languages | C (Arduino), Python  |
| Computer Vision | YOLO (via OpenCV + pre-trained model) |
| Communication | Serial over USB (pySerial) |
| Database | MariaDB |
| Threading & Concurrency | C `threading` module |
| IDEs & Tools | Arduino IDE, VS Code |
| Hardware Debugging | Oscilloscope, Logic Analyzer, Multimeter|

### 🔍 Features Implemented

- **YOLO-based license plate detection** on Raspberry Pi using camera input.
- **MariaDB** database used to store authorized license plates and access logs.
- **Serial communication** between Raspberry Pi and Arduino for barrier control.
- **Multithreading** on Raspberry Pi to independently control two physical barriers (entry & exit) in parallel.
- Real-time validation and response based on detected plate vs. database.

### 🧠 Key Learning Areas

- Embedded C programming on **Arduino** to control motors and sensors.
- **Python scripting** for computer vision, threading, and serial I/O.
- Integrating **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection models with live camera feed.
- Database design and integration using **MariaDB**.
